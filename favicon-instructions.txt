FAVICON INSTRUCTIONS

You'll need to add the following files to the public directory for your app icons:

1. favicon.ico - 16x16, 32x32, 48x48 (multi-size ICO file)
2. logo192.png - 192x192 PNG file
3. logo512.png - 512x512 PNG file

You can generate these files using a tool like:
- https://realfavicongenerator.net/
- https://favicon.io/

Create a simple icon that represents your organization management concept, 
such as a hierarchical chart structure or interconnected nodes.

Recommended colors:
- Primary: #3182CE (blue.500 in Chakra UI)
- Secondary: #38B2AC (teal.500 in Chakra UI)

Once generated, place these files in the public directory before deploying to Vercel.
